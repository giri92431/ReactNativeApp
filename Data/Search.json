The shakes actually taste nice, my favorite being the coffee caramel flavor, and not something like a cardboard grinder up. It's smooth, liquid (and not the usual thick consistency) and very palatable. Does help maintain optimum nutrition and helps keep energy levels up through the day.\n"

I got a very good deal on exchange offer for my previous IPhone 6s - Nothing wrong with it, however the latest IOS 11 update was taking a toll on the ageing battery, so is the upgrade).Since visually similar to 6s to 8, initially did not feel much difference (nowhere the number 8 written on the phone that can easily be seen). However when tried to take photos of fast moving objects the improvement in camera came into instance attention. The phone itself felt very snappy and raring to go on a rampage. Restoring from the previous backup, and take it on to a spin with whatever the daily chores it has to handle.Will come back with more updates once the things are settled a bit down)PS: I got a Spigen Liquid Crystal Case ordered and put on the phone. It looks much better than the previous Neo hybrid case - just in case anyone wants to know)\n"
